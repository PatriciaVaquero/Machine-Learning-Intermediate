## :pushpin: Machine-Learning-Intermediate

This repository is focused on those who have some prior knowledge in Python!

:warning: **IMPORTANT** :warning:

_YOU'LL NEED SOME FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE IN PYTHON TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE CONCEPTS COVERED IN THIS REPOSITORY_. I suggest you check out this repository [Machine Learning Basics](https://github.com/PatriciaVaquero/Machine-Learning-Basics), to ensure you will follow all the material without any problems.  

In this repository we will be covering the following Machine Learning Regression models:

- Linear Regression.

- Logistic Regression.

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

- Support Vector Machines (SVM).

- K-Means Clustering.

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

- Recommender Systems.

- Natural Language Processing (NLP).

- Deep Learning.

We will also introduce **Big Data and Spark**. 


We will use the following libraries:

- Numpy.

- Pandas.

- Matplotlib.

- Statsmodels.

- Sklearn.

- Seaborn.

_ENJOY CODING!_ :wink:
